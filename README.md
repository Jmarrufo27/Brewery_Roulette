* Brewery Roullette (Project 1)

* * In this assignment, we were to create an interactive website utilizing two serverside API's.

* * API's used are Brewerydb to gather bar information & Mapbox to gather location information.

* * WHEN a user wants to locate a bar in a specific city
* * THEN you click "Get Started" and enter the city name and state
* * THEN the user clicks on the mug icon to spin the roullette for a random bar
* * WHEN the bar populates, the user may either enter their website or "Save" the bar and spin
* * again.
